# Introduction to Data Science – Semester Project

This repository contains a complete machine learning project that applies classification and clustering techniques to real-world datasets using Python. The project includes exploratory data analysis, model training and evaluation, feature-wise comparison, and a fully structured academic report written in LaTeX.


## Overview

- **D-1 (Raisin Dataset)**: Feature-wise classification using KNN and Naïve Bayes.  
- **D-2 (HTRU2 Dataset)**: High-accuracy classification of pulsar data using incremental features.  
- **D-3 (Parking Dataset)**: K-Means clustering to uncover behavioral patterns in city parking.

The report covers methodology, model performance, visualizations, and an in-depth comparison of algorithm behavior.

## Requirements

This project uses Python 3.8+ and the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `jupyter`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

```jupyter notebook```

Then open any of the .ipynb files in your browser.

## Report

The full academic report is written using LaTeX and includes:

Introduction, Methodology, Results
Confusion matrices, Elbow plots, Feature progression graphs
Glossary, Bibliography (BibTeX)
Professional formatting (UET LaTeX style)
